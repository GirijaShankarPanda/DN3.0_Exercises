# Spring Data JPA with Spring Boot, Hibernate Exercises
## Employee Management System - Project Overview

This project is an Employee Management System built using Spring Boot. It manages employee data, departments, and their relationships, utilizing various Spring Boot features and best practices. Below is a brief overview of each exercise covered in this project:

## Exercise 1: Project Setup
1. **Initialize a Spring Boot Project**:
   - Set up a new Spring Boot project named `EmployeeManagementSystem`.
3. **Add Dependencies**:
   - Include Spring Data JPA, H2 Database, Spring Web, and Lombok.
5. **Configure Application Properties**:
   - Set up `application.properties` for H2 database connection and JPA.

## Exercise 2: Creating Entities
1. **Define JPA Entities**:
   - Create `Employee` and `Department` entities with appropriate fields.
3. **Entity Relationships**:
   - Establish a one-to-many relationship between `Department` and `Employee`.

## Exercise 3: Creating Repositories
1. **Overview of Spring Data Repositories**:
   - Understand the benefits of using Spring Data repositories for CRUD operations.
3. **Create Repositories**:
   - Develop `EmployeeRepository` and `DepartmentRepository` interfaces extending `JpaRepository`.

## Exercise 4: Implementing CRUD Operations
1. **CRUD Operations**:
   - Implement basic CRUD operations for employees and departments.
3. **RESTful Endpoints**:
   - Create `EmployeeController` and `DepartmentController` to manage these operations.

## Exercise 5: Defining Query Methods
1. **Custom Query Methods**:
   - Utilize method name keywords and `@Query` annotations to define custom query methods.
3. **Named Queries**:
   - Implement named queries using `@NamedQuery` and `@NamedQueries`.

## Exercise 6: Implementing Pagination and Sorting
1. **Pagination**:
   - Add pagination support for employee lists using `Page` and `Pageable`.
3. **Sorting**:
   - Incorporate sorting functionality and combine it with pagination.

## Exercise 7: Enabling Entity Auditing
1. **Entity Auditing**:
   - Implement auditing to track the creation and modification times of employees and departments using annotations like `@CreatedBy`, `@LastModifiedBy`, `@CreatedDate`, and `@LastModifiedDate`.

## Exercise 8: Creating Projections
1. **Projections**:
   - Define interface-based and class-based projections to fetch specific subsets of employee and department data.

## Exercise 9: Customizing Data Source Configuration
1. **Data Source Configuration**:
   - Customize data source settings and manage multiple data sources in your application.
3. **External Configuration**:
   - Use `application.properties` to externalize configuration.

## Exercise 10: Hibernate-Specific Features
- **Hibernate Annotations**: Utilize Hibernate-specific annotations for customized entity mappings.
- **Performance Optimization**: Configure Hibernate dialect and properties for optimal performance.
- **Batch Processing**: Implement batch processing with Hibernate for bulk operations.
